## Bering Sea (and adjacent) ROMS applications

This project holds the ROMS application data for Bering Sea-related regional modeling projects.  These projects combine a variety of different grids/domains, sea ice models, biological models, and ROMS versions.  The subApps folder holds info related to these individual compnents of a potential ROMS project, which can be combined together to create a full working app.

This is an ongoing research project that will be updated frequently alongside development within the [beringnpz/roms-bering-sea](https://github.com/beringnpz/roms-bering-sea) and [beringnpz/roms](https://github.com/beringnpz/roms) ROMS code versions.
