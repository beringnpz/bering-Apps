In Bering (new) only

ALBEDO_CSIM        ice albedo from CSIM... maybe?
ANA_DRAG           x analytical drag
ANA_NUDGCOEF       x analytical climatology nudging coefficients... don't think we need this (until we get to Fe, at least)
CICE_COUPLING      x different ice model
FILTERED           x some sort of filtering on averages outputs... I don't think we want this
IMPLICIT_NUDGING   implicit nudging in momentum radiation... figure out what this means and if we need it
LIMIT_BSTRESS      limits the magnitude of bottom stress... investigate whether this relates to bottom drag stuff
NO_HIS             x Turns off history file writing
NO_SCORRECTION_ICE Don't use SCORRECTION under the ice... consider?
PERFECT_RESTART    perfect restart... may want to consider this to eliminate some of our restart mass balance issues
RI_SPLINES         the splines options are new, have to do with spline reconstruction of vertical sheet, diffusivity, and viscosity... not sure if we should consider these
SPLINES_VDIFF      ""
SPLINES_VVISC      ""
UV_DRAG_GRID       Replaces RDRG_GRID, needs to be paired with either UV_LDRAG (idragL [rdrag]), UV_QDRAG (idragQ [rdrag2]), or UV_LOG_DRAG (idZoBL [ZoBot])
UV_QDRAG           see above
WET_DRY            x wetting/drying, don't need for Bering
WTYPE_GRID         Allows for spatially varying water type... we may want to look into this to replace sediment attenuation kludge, but check how it interacts with OPTICAL_MANTISSA
